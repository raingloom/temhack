# temhack
A simple AutoHotKey script for getting Tem to college.

# Usage
 - start the script
  - either install AutoHotKey and run it from the file manager or
  - run the compiled executable (you don't need to install anything for this to work)
 - empty your inventory
 - enter the shop
 - type "temhack" and then press enter
 - now you'll see a pop-up, type in how many rounds you want the script to run then press enter
  - one round: 8 golds
 - let it run

## Warning
Do not switch windows while the script is running, it cannot detect what window it is running in, so it will continue seding keystrokes! If you _do_ switch or you just want to stop the script, you can do that by right-clicking the AHK icon in your taskbar and choosing "pause script" or exiting AHK.
